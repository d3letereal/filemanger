# FileManager

A **Java-based file manager** created by me.  

This file manager includes all the features of a regular file manager, but with a key improvement: it **displays images and other files directly inside the app** instead of opening separate applications.  

## Features
- Browse files and folders
- Open and view images, videos, and text files directly
- Copy, move, delete, and rename files
- User-friendly interface

## Technologies
- Java
- JavaFX 
- File I/O operations

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your Java IDE
3. Run the `MainApp.java` file
4. Start managing your files seamlessly within the app
